I didn't get the episode with Marco and Cary edited and posted yet (came close - might still get it posted tonight when I get home).  In that episode Marco mentioned his <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/rest">free REST webinar</a> which occurs at three different times tomorrow (March 3rd).  So <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/rest">sign-up to attend</a> one of those sessions and download the white paper, it will be really good.
