Let me know if you have a specific <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/conferences/delphi_live/speaker/">speaker</a> from <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/">DelphiLive!</a> you would like interviewed on the podcast, and any specific questiosn you might have.  I've already contacted a few speakers at random,  but I am certainly open to interviewing all the speakers.  If you are a speaker then feel free to nominate yourself or just drop me an email.

With each speaker I plan to talk with them a little about their background, what they are up to, and what we can expect from their sessions.
