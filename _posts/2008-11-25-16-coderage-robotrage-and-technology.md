I am actually sitting outside a closed coffee shop using their free wifi in hopes I will be able to upload this.  I am on a family vacation and I didn't think about the fact that I wouldn't be able to easily get online whenever I needed to.

You may have noticed a change in format where I am using a lot of content I recorded from PDC.  Well that is because I am busy putting together session for <strong>CodeRage III </strong>that is coming up next week.  This looks to be a great conference.  The trick with Virtual conferences is actually taking the time to be committed to attending.  When you are still at work or whatever it is just too easy to get busy doing other things.  So do yourself a favor and schedule time to attend at least a couple of sessions where you are 100% in attendance with no other distractions.  You will be glad you did.

For more information on CodeRage III check out <a href="http://www.TheCodeRage.com/">www.TheCodeRage.com</a>.  It runs from Monday December 1st from 5 AM to 8 PM through Friday December 5th, so chances are you can find a time that works with your schedule.

Speaking of CodeRage, one of my sessions is the <strong>Revenge of Delphi Robot Rage</strong>.  This is a session where you can create a bot to compete in a 3D arena against other bots that were also created with Delphi.  The winner gets bragging rights and a valuable development related prize.  This year the arena is Unreal Tournament III, but you don't need to buy the game to compete.  You only need <a href="http://www.codegear.com/products/delphi/prism">Delphi Prism</a>.  Now Delphi Prism isn't out yet, but this was the first open Beta, and a lot of people were able to get in on the beta, or pick up a beta CD at PDC.  If you weren't able to do that, then you can still download the <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/trials">RemObjects Oxygene trail</a> and use that.  If none of those work for you, then maybe you can get creative and find another way.

For more information visit <a href="http://delphi.org/robot-rage/">www.delphi.org/robot-rage/ </a>where you can download the SDK.  The only requirement is you submit source that can be compiled in either Delphi 2009 or Delphi Prism.  You have until midnight Pacific time on <strong>December 3rd </strong>to submit your robot.  That way I will have time to have them face off and record the battle.

For the podcast this week I have what I believe is a real treat.  After I finished recording <a href="http://delphi.org/2008/10/episode-12-nick-marc-allen-on-delphi-prism/">Episode 12 with Nick, marc and Allen at PDC</a> we all started discussing technology, specifically where it was headed and where it had been.  This is a real candid conversation, and I happened to record it as well.  Keep in mind everyone here was just talking as themselves, and not speaking for the companies they work for, so there are no official statements or anything like that.  Just four guys having a nice conversation.  We started out talking about how long the 64-bit architecture would be enough before we needed to jump to whatever is next . . .
