I had been meaning to post this video for a while . . .  Here is <a href="http://www.marcocantu.com/">Marco Cantu</a>'s popular <em>Fun Side of Delphi: Unicode Edition</em> from <strong>Delphi Live! 2009</strong>.

<object width="437" height="370" data="http://www.viddler.com/player/89883396/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="viddler" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/89883396/" /><param name="name" value="viddler" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>

It is almost a full hour in length, but fairly entertaining. You might actually learn something about Unicode or Delphi too.

It is currently hosted on <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/jimmckeeth/videos/10/">Viddler</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/5387116">Vimeo</a>.  Hopefully Vimeo does a better job of synchronizing the audio to the video.  It is unfortunately too long for YouTube.  You can download the original MP4 from <a href="http://vimeo.com/5387116">Vimeo</a> though, which I hope is formatted properly for an iPod Touch and iPhone (someone let me know).

If you had trouble with some of the previous videos I uploaded then you might want to go check them out again as I have replaced some of them with better copies.  If you still are having trouble then leave a comment and I will update it when I can.

There have been some comments asking for specific resources, and I will get to them soon.  Between Delphi Live!, catching up at work, traveling to see family, and Cub Scout camp this week I am still behind, but I will get to all your comments soon!
