I have been quite surprised at the amount of feedback and suggestions that have been submitted via <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>.  The way UserVoice works is everyone gets 10 votes to use until the things they voted on are either completed or deleted. I know <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/">Nick Hodges</a> has been following it rather closely (and commenting), but thought it would be a good idea to actually go through the list of top requests with him and discuss which ones we might be expecting to see in the future, and delete any that are completely off topic.  This will free up more votes and also provides a little feedback on the process.  <em>Don't be expecting any hard dates, features or an official road map though. </em>This is just a two way feedback process.

With the beta of Delphi "Weaver" possibly starting this month, I am sure its feature set is pretty fixed, but we already know there are big changes further down the road.

In addition to talking about UserVoice, as part of our <em><a href="http://www.delphilive.com/">road to DelphiLive!</a></em> series I will be talking with Nick about his <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/konferenzen/delphi_live/speaker/#3872">sessions at DelphiLive!</a>, which includes his what's cooking in the Delphi labs.  I'm sure he won't give away all the details about what he will be sharing then, but I imagine we can get a little sampling.

So if you haven't yet, head out to <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a> and make some suggestions and vote for your favorites.  If you get them in before we record the podcast on Thursday then we might discuss them on the podcast.
