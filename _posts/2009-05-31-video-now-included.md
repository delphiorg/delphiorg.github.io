Sorry about no video being included in the <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/05/what-is-cooking-in-the-delphi-labs-7/">last post</a>.  For some reason I couldn't access my admin console right in the middle of posting.  I think my hosting provider decides to block me occasionally because I do too many things at once.  The <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/05/what-is-cooking-in-the-delphi-labs-7/">video is now there</a>.  Enjoy!  I think I have one more video to post from the labs, and then I am on to a couple of the other segments I recorded.
