This is basically an experiment with the new <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing tool from TechSmith</a> and creating a screen cast with Delphi 2009.  Just so you know up front, there is no editing, so you are getting the raw screen cast (although I did a few takes) so it isn't as polished as my usual podcast.

</ul>
You can <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/JimMcKeeth/folders/Default/media/81ce5be3-e014-463d-a251-049e89535be8/1-AddingExploreTool.swf">download the SWF</a> file or use the link above to view it online.  It is really small (5.64 MB) and should stream quickly.  Like I said, this is an experiment, so I would really like your feedback on the process so I can tune future screen casts better.

Thanks!

[<strong>Update</strong>: I took off the enclosure.  I don't think most video players can handle the SWF file anyway.]
