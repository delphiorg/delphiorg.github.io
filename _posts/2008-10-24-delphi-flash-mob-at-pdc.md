To all Delphi developers (past, present and future) who are attending PDC next week, be sure to stop by CodeGear's booth to find out about the time of the Delphi Flash Mob.  I'll also post details here and via <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmckeeth">my Twitter feed</a>.

What is a flash mob?  Think of it as planned improvising.  PDC offers Open Spaces meeting areas for attendees to arrange their own impromptu sessions.  Kind of like Birds of a Feather sessions of old.  So plan on meeting there to discuss Delphi.  <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/abauer/">Allen Bauer</a> has already volunteered to talk about anything he can and answer questions.  It should be a great opportunity to learn more about Delphi.  So bring your questions, or post them here now and we can be ready to address them there.

Remember: Details at CodeGear's booth, on this blog, or <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmckeeth">via Twitter</a> (check the <a href="http://delphi.org/twitter">Twitter page for more Delphi Twitterati</a>)
