I remember when I was getting started in Delphi programming (I started late with Delphi 2 as a long time Turbo Pascal developer) and I discovered the huge catalog of mostly free components on <a href="http://www.torry.net/">Torry.net</a> I thought I was in heaven.

Not only is Torry's still updating with new components, tools, code samples and applications (see the list of updates in the last 7 days) they just updated their footer to include the following:
<blockquote>The Ultimate Source of Object Pascal and Delphi Programming Knowledge.</blockquote>
That should shift some more of their 19,900 pages about Delphi onto the TPCI.  Previously only 35 pages contained the phrase "Delphi programming".  That is a boost of up to 19,865 pages (depending on how many Google and other search engines index.)
