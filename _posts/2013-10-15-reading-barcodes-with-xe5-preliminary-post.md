Fernando Rizotto has an example of using <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/43269">XE4 on iOS to read a barcode</a>. He is using an iOS specific library. Another library that is available on both iOS and Android is <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>. It is a full open source computer vision library with a lot of great features, one of which is reading barcodes.
