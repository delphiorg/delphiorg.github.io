Marco Cantu has a new <a href="http://www.marcocantu.com/dh2010/">Delphi 2010</a> book coming out.  Cary Jensen has a new Advantage Database Server 10 book coming out.  Together they have their <a href="http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/">Delphi Developer Days</a> coming up.  Now is your chance to ask them about any of these topics, or get their opinion on any other news in the Delphi community, or stump them with a technical question.  Post your questions or vote for other questions.  I'll do my best to ask the top questions.

I've setup a separate Uservoice forum for your questions.  Be sure to log-in so I can ask you questions in case I need more information!  Anonymous questions are OK too though.

The interview is scheduled for <em>9 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday the 24th</em>.  Get your questions in before then!
