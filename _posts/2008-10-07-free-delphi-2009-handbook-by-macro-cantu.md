Hopefully you all just got an email from <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/michaelswindell">Michael Swindell</a> with the subject line "Product Update: Delphi and C++Builder Changes."   The email address it comes from is "CodeGear from Embarcadero" &lt;e-update@email.codegear.com&gt;.  If not, then check your spam folders and furiously refresh your in-box until it shows up.

The email is a request to update your contact information (which seems like an odd request since they obviously have my email address), although I think it is just a matter of getting us to agree to a privacy policy / terms of use with the new company.  I'm happy to maintain contact with CodeGear &amp; Embarcadero, but the carrot they offer in return is a <strong>free </strong>PDF copy of <a href="http://www.marcocantu.com/">Marco Cantu</a>'s yet to be released <em>Delphi 2009 Handbook</em>.

They will email the download link later.  I can hardly wait.  Now I just need to get an autographed hard copy.  I'll be sure to pack a copy when I go to the <a href="http://delphi.org/2008/10/episode-8-roundtable-on-best-practices/">physical Delphi conference</a> CodeGear is planning.
