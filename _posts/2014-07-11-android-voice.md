That is pretty cool because it allows you to launch a Google Glass app with your voice, but I decided to expand on that to also show how the Google Glass app can be launched with the results of additional voice input, as well as how to take dictation and do text to speech everywhere else in Android.

I've still got a lot of work to do on the components, but they work as is for now. If you want to modify the component code then take a look at my <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/07/custom-classes-dex/">Skill Sprint and blog post on the Android JNI Bridge</a>.
