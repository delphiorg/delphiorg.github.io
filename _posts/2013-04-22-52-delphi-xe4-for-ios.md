The big news for Today, April 22nd, 2013 is the release of <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio">RAD Studio XE4</a> which includes the new <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi for iOS</a>. I thought it would be fitting to talk with <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/">Marco Cantu</a>, long time Delphi author and supporter who recently took over as the Delphi product manager.
