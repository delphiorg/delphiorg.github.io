I am sure everyone is excited about the openness with the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39174">Delphi road map</a> (and <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39265">Prism roadmap</a>), and now they have announced their <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/beta_programs.php">upcoming beta program</a> for Delphi "Weaver".

What do we know about <em>Weaver</em>?  Well, we are expecting it will be released mid2009, and have are guessing the version as 2010.  It won't have the full 64-bit compiler, but it will have a preview I am expecting a command-line only compiler, so no debugger.

It may have the new front end compiler architecture, which sounds like it might get us closer to Delphi Prism syntax compatibility.

So what do you want to see in the new Delphi?  New features?  Bug fixes?  Minor tweaks?  You can make your suggestions on the <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">Delphi User Voice page</a>.  Then we can all vote on them.
