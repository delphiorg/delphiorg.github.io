There has been a lot of <a href="http://tech.turbu-rpg.com/116/personal-property-and-computing">f</a><a href="http://delphi.org/2010/04/monotouch-and-the-new-iphone-license/">u</a><a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/iarrogance.html">s</a><a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/2451-apple-banning-flash-applications-from-iphone-4-0-that-stinks.html">s</a> lately about the lack of openness on apple's platform.  There is still time for things to change, and hopefully this ends as a win for developers and consumers, but unless Apple changes their tune there will be no winners, only losers.

The general consensus among the developers falls into two camps:
<ol>
	<li>Apple should open their platform and let people develop however they want.</li>
	<li>Objective-C and XCode is all roses, why use anything else?</li>
</ol>
Personally I fall in the first camp (which you probably guessed from my opening paragraph.)  I think it would be great if Apple's platforms were open and I could use most any tool as long as I called the correct API and use the right UI controls.

At the same time I disagree with those who believe <a href="http://tech.turbu-rpg.com/116/personal-property-and-computing">laws should be passed, or lawyers retained</a> to regulate how open Apple makes their platform, all in the name of freedom.  I've got news for you, <strong><em>freedom means Apple can decide to not have an open platform</em></strong>.

I may disprove of Apple's actions, but I will defend their right to do it.  That is what is known as freedom, and I will not give up freedom for the benefit of openness.  If I want openness to be an option in the future, then that means allowing Apple the freedom to have a closed platform today.

<strong>Giving up freedom for openness means loosing both. </strong>

<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire">Voltaire</a> wrote "Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too," which Evelyn Beatrice Hall summarized as "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."

<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin">Ben Franklin</a> said "Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor Liberty to purchase power," which was later paraphrased as "Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little  security will deserve neither and lose both."

Seeking to take away Apple's freedom for the sake of openness is to sacrifice the very freedom that allows others to make open platforms.  So if we take away that freedom and we give up our freedom to be open.

I'll just remind you of <a href="http://twitter.com/NickHodges/status/10291243908">Hodges 1st Law</a> before someone makes another car analogy, they don't work anyway.
