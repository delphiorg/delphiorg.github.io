<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-804" title="Community Nominee" src="/assets/images/2009/11/community-nominee.jpg" alt="Community Nominee" />John Thomas of <a href="http://Wings-of-Wind.com/">Wings-of-Wind.com</a> started a community poll.  Originally he was calling it the <a href="http://wings-of-wind.com/2009/10/13/spirit-of-delphi-award-2009/">Spirit of Delphi award</a>, but then it was pointed out that the Spirit of Delphi is awarded by the Delphi R&amp;D team.  Well John didn't let this discourage him, so he renamed it the Delphi Legends Community Award.

John kicked off <a href="http://wings-of-wind.com/2009/10/17/spirit-of-delphi-award-2009-the-poll/">the poll</a> process by nominating Zarko Gajic of Delphi.About.Com and Peter Below of TeamB.  Then the community nominated a number of others, including myself.  Just being nominated among such other great Delphi legends is quite an honor.

In the end around <a href="http://wings-of-wind.com/2009/10/24/delphi-legends-2009-community-award/">500 developers voted</a> and I received 11% of the votes, ending up with 4th place, making me a Nominee.  The other winners are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.delphipraxis.net/impressum.php">Daniel R. Wolf</a> of Delphi PRAXiS with the Gold award,</li>
	<li><a href="http://delphi.about.com/bio/Zarko-Gajic-3522.htm">Zarko Gajic</a> with the Silver award</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.teamb.com/list#peterbelow">Peter Below</a> with the Bronze award.</li>
</ul>
Other nominees include

	<li><a href="http://gp.17slon.com/">Primoz Gabrijelcic</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://delphiforfun.org/">Gary Darby</a></li>
