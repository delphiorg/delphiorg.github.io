Talking with <a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh/">marc hoffman</a> of <a href="http://remobjects.com/">RemObjects</a> about the <a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh/2009/05/07/p280">latest Delphi Prism release</a>.  A large portion of this episode focuses on Aspect Oriented Programming with the <a href="http://prismwiki.codegear.com/en/RemObjects_Cirrus">Cirrus framework</a> and Delphi Prism.  We also talk about a number of the other features in this latest May 2009 release.

Yeah, this one is a little long.  The last bit is marc and I shooting the breeze for a bit about whatever.

This was also recorded out of order.  It was recorded before episodes <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/04/28-ray-konopka/">28</a> and <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/05/29-pawel-glowacki/">29</a>.  I lost my original recordings and had to recreate it from marc's recordings.  We had some lost audio in the call too, but it ended up coming out pretty good.

BTW, <a href="http://www.CyberEars.com/">CyberEars</a> (the podcast host) upgraded their download servers so we should have faster download speeds.  Let me know if you can tell a difference.  Also I replaced <a href="http://delphi.org/2008/10/episode-8-roundtable-on-best-practices/">episode 8</a> that I accidently deleted a while ago.  Sorry about that!
