I'm joining Bob Swart and Cary Jensen for the U.S. cities of their annual <a href="http://delphideveloperdays.com/">Delphi Developer Days</a> 2014 tour with the keynote and a free evening event. During my keynote and the evening session I'll show off Google Glass development with XE6, as well as using an EEG <a class="zem_slink" title="Brain–computer interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Brain-Computer Interface</a> to control a Mini-Cooper via Bluetooth.

I highly recommend you find time to attend the whole two days of training. I always learn a lot.

Delphi Developer Days are two-day live Delphi events that provide you with the latest information on Delphi as well as practical techniques to help you improve your Delphi development skills. Each event includes both joint sessions, presented by Bob and Cary together, as well as simultaneous tracks, where Cary and Bob break out into separate rooms to present individual sessions. There is also an <a class="zem_slink" title="Embarcadero Technologies" href="http://www.embarcadero.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Embarcadero Technologies</a> Keynote by Jim McKeeth and guest speaker sessions with Nick Hodges (former Delphi product manager) of Veeva Systems in DC/Baltimore, and with Ray Konopka of Raize Software in Chicago.

A wide variety of topics are covered. Some topics, such as FireDAC and mobile development, apply to the latest versions of Delphi, but there are also many topics that apply across many versions of Delphi.
