One of my favorite new features (beyond Linux) is the ability to edit the data in a <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/en/FireDAC.Comp.Client.TFDMemTable">TFDMemTable</a> at design time. You could already <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/en/Data.DB.TDataSet.FieldDefs">edit the field defs</a>, to set it up. This makes the TFDMemTable, which was already super flexible and powerful, even more flexible. You can use it to capture some small data at design time and then use visual live bindings or data binding to connect it to visual controls.

<a href="https://flixengineering.com/archives/421">Holger Flick has a great blog post</a> on the topic too. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to-IkTEIfaU">video I made with Sarina</a> that shows it in action.
