There is a new programming community site on the internet today.  It has been in beta for a while, but today it is open to the public.  The site is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and it is the brain child of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Attwood</a> and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>.  If you are software developer who reads blogs then you have most likely heard of them and read their work.  

Think of Stack Overflow as a combination of a Wiki with a Forum.  There is a little bit of Digg / Reddit thrown in and a touch of a blog.  Here is Jeff's Venn diagram to explain it:

<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/stackoverflow-venn-diagram.png"><img class="alignnone" title="Stack Overflow Venn Diagram" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/stackoverflow-venn-diagram.png" alt="" width="440" height="431" /></a>

So that little asterisk in the middle.  Everything is tagged, so you can filter for only the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/delphi">Delphi questions</a>.  It is pretty active and sometimes it is good to see how the other side lives.  There is a pretty good community forming already.  

I am trying to keep an eye on the Delphi questions, there are currently 37 of them, but I occasionally check out other topics too.  It doesn't replace <a href="https://forums.codegear.com/index.jspa">CodeGear's forums</a> (which now have an accept answer feature) but I like the fact it is much more focused to being on the topic of a question and an answer and less on a discussion.

So far I have seen some past guests on our podcast there including both <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2044/nick-hodges">Nick Hodges</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3712/barry-kelly">Barry Kelly</a>.  When will I see you out there?  Put a link in the comments.  I'll be sure to vote up most Delphi questions and good answers too.
