<img class="alignright" title="Nick Hodges" src="/assets/images/guests/NickHodges.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="196" />Welcome to Episode 27 of the Podcast at Delphi.org for Monday the 20th of April, 2009.

This episode was recorded with Nick Hodges on Thursday, the 17th of April, 2009.  Nick discusses his new role as an R&amp;D manager and some of the other changes going on at CodeGear.  Also discuss the upcoming release of Delphi, the DelphiLive! conference, and some of the suggestions on <a href="http://Delphi.UserVoice.com/">Delphi.UserVoice.com</a>.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/">Nick Hodges</a> is now a <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/2009/04/14/39230">Delphi R&amp;D Manager</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/michaelrozlog/">Michael Rozlog</a> takes over his role as <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/michaelrozlog/2009/04/17/36970">Delphi product manager</a>.</li>
	<li>Delphi 2009 Update 3 is literally days away now.</li>
	<li>Be sure to leave your feedback on the <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">Delphi UserVoice</a> page.  There are four forums, so if you don't see the feature request you are looking for, it may be in a different forum.  Nick said Embarcadero is looking at all their user feedback, including User Voice.  We marked a bunch of the suggestions with updated status.</li>
	<li>Wanna see what is next in Delphi?  Sign up for the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/beta_programs.php">Delphi Weaver and Delphi Prism betas</a>.  Nick suggested that pretty much everyone who signs up will get accepted but are some pretty tough questions that you need to answer.</li>
	<li></a>Another great way to see what is coming up in the world of Delphi is to attend <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/">DelphiLive!</a> of course we have a few <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/04/25-delphilive/">podcasts about it too</a>.</li>
	<li>You may be surprised how much more you can get for a little more money with <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/all_access/">Embarcadero's All Access</a>, which we also have a <a href="http://delphi.org/2009/02/23-datarage-and-all-access/">podcast about it too</a>.  They are working on the Delphi instant-on still though.  It may be a platform for a <a href="http://thedorictemple.blogspot.com/2009/04/component-itunes.html">component iTunes</a>, which would be really cool.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39174">Future of the Delphi compiler</a> is still comming.</li>
</ul>
The episodes with Nick are always great ones, so I hope you enjoy it!  If there are other links I missed please add those in the comments.
