As was mentioned in this week's Podcast, <a href="http://conferences.codegear.com/coderage08">CodeRage III is coming</a>.

Anders is currently <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/ao/2008/10/08/38949">looking for speakers</a>.

As Anders mentioned, this is not to replace a face-to-face conference, but is only until a physical conference is scheduled.  I planning on submitting a few sessions.  I'll see you all in the chat rooms!
