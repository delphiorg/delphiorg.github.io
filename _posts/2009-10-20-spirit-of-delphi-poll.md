Typically the Spirit of Delphi award winner is chosen by the Delphi R&amp;D team, but this year it would appear there is a <a href="http://wings-of-wind.com/2009/10/17/spirit-of-delphi-award-2009-the-poll/">community poll</a>.  I am quite honored to find myself on the list of nominees.  To be numbered among such other great contributors is a treat in itself.

I encourage you all to get out and vote in the poll.  It closes this Saturday the 24th of October.
