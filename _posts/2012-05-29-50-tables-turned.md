<a href="http://www.simonjstuart.com/">Simon J Stuart</a> and <a href="http://jamiei.com/">Jamie Ingilby</a> turn the tables on Jim McKeeth and interview him for this 50th episode.

This episode is our longest yet, but it was a lot of fun. Hopefully you will enjoy this candid episode where we discuss a wide range of topics.
