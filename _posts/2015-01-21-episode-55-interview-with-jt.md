An interview with John Thomas "JT", Senior Director of Product Management over RAD Studio and Delphi with Embarcadero Technologies.This episode was recorded almost a year and a half ago, right after the XE5 release added Android support, but is still a relevant conversation today.

It is 2 weeks from our last episode, so we are going to try and keep it at an episode every 2 weeks for now and see how that goes. Also we are moving to Soundcloud for audio hosting.
