As I mentioned in the <a href="http://delphi.org/2008/08/episode-2-nick-hodges/">podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.gurock.com/">Gurock Software</a> is donating a free copy of their SmartInspect tracing and debugging application for one lucky listener.  If you are interested in winning a copy then download the 30-day trial of Smart Inspect version 3.0.  Test it out and then send me your short review and comments.  I’ll share those comments in a future podcast and announce the winner then.  Please post your entries as comments here, or if you would like to submit a short audio clip, you can email it to <a href="mailto:jim@delphi.org">jim@delphi.org</a>.  All entries must be received by Thursday, September 4st, 2008.
