<a href="/assets/images/2008/10/dr_deadline_co.pdf"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-351" title="Dr. Deadline" src="/assets/images/2008/10/dr_deadline.png" alt="" /></a>It would appear Dr. Deadline has returned in an attempt to foil the plans of <a href="http://delphi.org/2008/10/return-of-delphi-man/">Delphi Man</a>!  Thanks to the amazing <a href="http://tdelphihobbyist.blogspot.com/">Dave Keighan</a> for sending me an original <a href="/assets/images/2008/10/dr_deadline_co.pdf">Dr. Deadline PDF</a>.  Maybe print out and give one of these to your manager. . . .

Thanks to B. Peuthert who pointed out that we can learn more about the original adventures of <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/20297">Turboman</a> in the <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/museum">CodeGear Museum</a>!  Now if we can just get him to snap some pictures of him with his inflatables!  I'd love to post them here!

My son is really getting into this superhero stuff.  He suggested Courageous CodeGear as the group all the superheroes belong to.

Anyone else have any developer super hero swag?  Send me a picture or a link and I will post it here.  Or maybe you have a new superhero / supervillian name or original artwork?  Just leave me a comment!
