There was a noticeable lack of a podcast covering Delphi programming specific topics.  Since I really wanted one to listen to I figured I might as well make one.  I'll interview people in the Delphi community that I think are interesting, and explore news and technology that looks cool to me.

I am going to start out with a weekly audio podcast, but in the future I hope to add video podcasts (or whatever you want to call them) and textual articles as well.  It will be a lot of fun.  Let me know what you would like me to cover, and if I like the suggestion I might do it.

Just remember, Delphi Rocked before Dot Net did!
