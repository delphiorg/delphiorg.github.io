Delphi Man has been sighted in Germany at <a href="http://www.vario-software.de/">Vario Software</a>, makers of the <a href="http://www.ticare.de/">Ticare bug tracking software</a> for Delphi with Delphi!  Benjamin Peuthert sent me a picture of his team with Delphi Man and Dr. Deadline.  Notice how they keep the two of them separated so they don't do battle during the picture!

I asked Benjamin to tell me a little about their bug tracking software and he told me (edited and formatted by me):
<blockquote>The most important feature at the moment is the Delphi plug-in, but some more cool and Delphi exclusive features are already in development.  You have a list of your tasks in the IDE and can enter the time spent for a task directly in Delphi.  Here are some <a href="http://www.ticare.de/ticare-in-delphi-einbinden/">screen shots</a>.

.

I hope we finish the translation within the next two weeks. But yes, at the moment information is only available in German. Check out the <a href="http://www.ticare.de/">product information</a> is located, or information about <a href="http://www.vario-software.de/">our company</a>.</blockquote>
Thanks to Benjamin and his whole team!  I look forward to hearing more about this great Delphi add-in, which I am sure Delphi Man uses in his battle against Dr. Deadline.

I love hearing about successful Delphi teams and seeing pictures of happy developers!  Anyone else out there with Delphi Man inflatables who wants to send me a picture?
