At 1:45 AM today <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/abauer">Allen Bauer</a> will be presenting an open space session on Delphi 2009.  Be sure to show up with your Delphi questions and to find out what is new in Delphi 2009.  I'll be there and would love to meet you too.

I picked up my <a href="http://www.codegear.com/products/delphi/prism/">Delphi Prism</a> DVD too.  I'll post some interesting details on that later.  Just in case you missed the <a href="http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=78294">news</a> (or didn't see it coming), it is powered by the <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/oxygene.aspx">RemObjects Oxygene</a> compiler.  From what I can tell they have exclusively licensed it. 

PDC has been really interesting.  I've been live posting to <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmckeeth">Twitter</a> as much as I can, and much more frequently then I can here.  I've already done a couple of interviews that I will be posting later too.  Need to find some good WiFi.  I am on one of the provided PC's right now.  BTW, IE 8 Beta doesn't seem it like WordPress's Admin page.  Don't think I can get Firefox installed though.
