Previous Delphi community member <a href="http://www.linotadros.com/2009/01/13/TheGiftOfLife.aspx">Lino Tadros lives</a> after his heart stopped and came out of a stroke induced comma on Christmas day.  He is home and recovering now.

After you read his post and wish him well, tell someone who is special to you that you love them and count your blessings.  I know too many people who have lost a loved one in an instant like that before.  Count your blessings today, give thanks to God, and remember what is important.  As much fun as Delphi development is, take a break and hold your kids, hug your spouse, call your mom, etc.  Delphi will only get better why you are away.

The fact the sun rose this morning and I am still breathing is a great miracle.  The rest is beyond belief.
