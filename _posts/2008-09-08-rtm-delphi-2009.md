It is official, Delphi 2009 has been released to manufacturing, and some lucky individuals are actually receiving downloads.  I had a suspicion of this when I posted my podcast, but wanted to be sure.  Nick Hodges posted a <a href="http://twitter.com/NickHodges/statuses/898333733">Twitter</a> that he was "Sitting in on our internal company launch call," which made me suspect it was the Delphi launch, but then <a href="http://www.bobswart.nl/weblog/Blog.aspx?RootId=5:2642">Dr. Bob posted</a> that he was sending out ESD licenses to BeNeLux customers, and now <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/ao/2008/09/08/38943">Anders has posted</a> that it in fact was RTM at 4 PM on Sunday.

Happy day!  Although I was expecting a press release or something really official looking like they did when they made it available for sale.
