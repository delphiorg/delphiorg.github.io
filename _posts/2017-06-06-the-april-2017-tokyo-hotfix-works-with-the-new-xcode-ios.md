Apple pushed out a new Xcode and iOS this week with WWDC. Naturally I updated and tried it. Xcode version 8.3.3 (8E3004b) and iOS version 10.3.2 (14F89). I'm running 10.2 Tokyo with the <a href="http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/30764">April 2017 Hotfix</a> and it all worked as expected. I deployed to my iPad and the iPhone simulator (I don't have an iPhone anymore, upgrade to a Pixel XL!)

Are you running Toyko 10.2 with the April 2017 Hotfix? There are updates coming too. Check out the <a href="https://community.embarcadero.com/article/news/16519-rad-studio-roadmap-may-2018">roadmap</a> to see what is planned for 10.2.1 &amp; 10.2.2. Great new features and a lot of fixes too!
