Monday's podcast will feature an interview with <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/" target="_blank">RemObject</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh" target="_blank">marc hoffman</a>.  <a href="http://www.codegear.com/products/delphi/prism">Delphi Prism</a> has been released, and it is powered by the <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/oxygene.aspx#2">RemObjects Oxygene</a> compiler.   If you have any questions about the Oxygene Compiler then this is your opportunity to ask them of marc, as he is the Chief Software Architect for RemObjects.

Please, leave your questions in the box below, and I will cover what I can with marc.  Remember, keep your questions focused on Oxygene and RemObjects as marc won't be able to answer questions on behalf of <a href="http://www.Codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> or <a href="http://www.Embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a>.
