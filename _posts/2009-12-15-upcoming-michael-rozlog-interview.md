I need your questions!

<a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/michaelrozlog/">Michael Rozlog</a> has agreed to an interview.  I am planning to discuss his roll as the Delphi Product Manager, the Delphi Survey, the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39934">Delphi Road Map</a> and your questions from the comments on this post.  The interview is scheduled for Thursday, so I need your question before then.  Try to keep the question short and succinct.  If you have a bug report, please use QC.  If you have an issue in QC then please include the QC number.

If you would like to email me an audio question or use the Delphi Hot Line to submit a question you can do that too.  My email address is thepodcast@delphi.org or call (361) 4Delphi.  You can also post your questions to a <strong><a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/pages/36301-michael-rozlog-questions">special user voice forum</a></strong>, which might be the best way so I can ask you questions back about your question.
