I was thinking about the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/42544">Delphi Mobile Roadmap</a> and got the idea of making some Highway signs to illustrate that theme. Mostly for fun.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/images/2013/07/Delphi-XE4-iPhone-Windows-Mac-OS-X.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1184 aligncenter" alt="Delphi XE4 - iPhone, Windows &amp; Mac OS X" src="/assets/images/2013/07/Delphi-XE4-iPhone-Windows-Mac-OS-X-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
Feel free to share this image with others who may be looking for direction to reach iPhone, iPad, Windows and OS X from a single tool.
