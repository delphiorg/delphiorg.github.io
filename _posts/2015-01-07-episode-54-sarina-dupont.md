Welcome back to the Podcast at Delphi.org. This is my first podcast since I've started working for <a class="zem_slink" title="Embarcadero Technologies" href="http://www.embarcadero.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Embarcadero Technologies</a> back in 2013. When I first started I'd planned to resurrect the podcast, but got caught up with all the new projects, travel and excitement and it fell by the wayside.

With the New Year it seems fitting to recommit to the podcast. I've got a lot of changes planned. I'm not sure about the frequency format and other details, but figure it is better to get a rolling start.

I actually recorded this interview with <a title="Sarina's Blog" href="http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/blogs/blogger/listall/sarina-dupont-embarcadero-com" target="_blank">Sarina DuPont</a> (<a title="Sarina on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sarinadupont" target="_blank">@SarinaDuPont</a>) back in August of 2013, right before the <a title="Embarcadero RAD Studio" href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio" target="_blank">RAD Studio</a> XE5 release added Android support. So some of the comments are dated in that regard, but most of it is still relevant. So while XE5, XE6 and XE7 have all shipped since the podcast, Sarina is still a product manager and the focus of getting to know her and her vision for RAD Studio is still relevant.

Typically I am in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Embarcadero Technologies, Scotts Valley, California" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embarcadero+Technologies/@37.062788,-122.007262,15z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x0:0xbb0a4d19b3d051c4!2sEmbarcadero+Technologies!3m1!1s0x0:0xbb0a4d19b3d051c4" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Scotts Valley</a> office about one week a month. My plan is to start recording some interviews when I am there. I've really enjoyed getting to know people behind the scenes with my favorite development tools, and hope you will too.

In the next episode I'll have an interview with <a title="JT's Blog" href="http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/blogs/blogger/listall/jt" target="_blank">John Thomas</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/FireMonkeyPM" target="_blank">@FireMonkeyPM</a>), or JT, the Senior Director of Product Management here at Embarcadero Technologies.
