In this episode I talk with <a href="http://jamie.op-i.net/blog/">Jamie Ingilby</a>, Steven Kamradt and  <a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh">marc hoffman</a>.  We introduce the Delphi Projects series which focuses on simple useful projects written in Delphi.  Our first project is a Twitter client written in Delphi Win32.

This episode is the start of a series of podcasts.  I thought it would be more interesting if there was something more to this podcast then just interviewing people and discussing Delphi news.  So what we have done is started a series of Delphi projects that a small group of volunteers will work on and then discuss how the project goes via the podcast.  Our first projects is a Twitter client written in Delphi.

Leave suggestions for names for the client in the comments.  <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/abauer/">Allen Bauer</a> is already using the <a href="http://twitter.com/kylix_rd/status/961063820">Delphitter name</a>.  I am kind of leaning towards something that combines both Delphi and Twitter, but it needs to not contain the whole word "Twitter," but you can be creative too.  I'll set up a poll with all the suggestions so everyone can vote.  I have a name in mind already, but I am not attached to it.

If you are excited about this then please spread the word!
