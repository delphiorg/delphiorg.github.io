Talking with Nick Hodges, former Delphi product manager, Spirit of Delphi award winner, development manager at <a href="http://www.gatewayticketing.com/">Gateway Ticketing</a>, and all around great guy. This was originally going to be part of a series of pre-release podcasts highlighting XE3, but that didn't work out. Before talking with Nick I did a little coverage on XE3 and Oxygene 5.2, including the new Nougat flavor. I'll have more coverage on XE3 and Oxygene 5.2 in future podcasts.

Nick and I discuss unit testing, development methodology, the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/delphi-spring-framework/">Spring Framework</a> and other interesting topics on Delphi development.

[Fixed the audio!]
