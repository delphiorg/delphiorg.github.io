In a few of our podcasts we have discussed Twitter so I have created the <a href="http://delphi.org/twitter/">Definitive Delphi Twitter Directory</a>.  If you have JavaScript enabled then you will also get the last 5 twitters by each person on the page.

It currently only has a few people in there.  I tried to choose previous guests, but it is late and I know I missed people.  So let me know if you Twitter about Delphi Programming and I will add you to the directory.  Additionally if there someone who you follow who Twitter's about Delphi Programming and I will add them to the list.

This uses a modified version of the <a href="http://twitter.com/badges/html">JavaScript badge</a> provided by Twitter via JSON.  If you know JavaScript and want to tweak the <a href="http://delphi.org/scripts/twitter.js">modified script</a> to include photos and their bio let me know.  Just comment bellow and I will email you (leave your email in the field and only I will see it!)
