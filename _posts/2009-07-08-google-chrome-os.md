I read something a while ago where someone was speculating that Google might be planning to move their Android OS to Netbooks.  Well it looks like they had a different plan for Netbooks: <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a>.  Take their fairly robust browser and bolt Linux onto it, and you have an OS specifically designed to run web applications . . . . like Google Docs, GMail, etc.  And it can run on your Desktop too!

And thanks to <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a> you can run Silverlight applications under it as well.
