Remember my blog post about <a href="http://delphi.org/2016/06/what-is-delphis-dna/">Delphi's DNA</a>? We've been working on making it into an Infographic, and now people are asking about creating a poster of it too! What do you think? Do you want a DNA poster for your wall? What suggestions or change<a href="/assets/images/2017/02/DelphiDNA.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2713" src="/assets/images/2017/02/DelphiDNA-578x1024.png" alt="Delphi's highly evolved DNA makes it the best development tool for any platform and any project." width="578" height="1024" /></a>s would you make?
