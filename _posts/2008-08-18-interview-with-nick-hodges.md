I am collecting some questions to ask Nick in our interview this week.  If you have any questions you would like considered for the interview please include them here.  I want to interview him early this week, so post your questions right away.

I am experimenting with a new anti-spam system on this blog.  It claims no false positives, so no-one should be rejected.  If you have any trouble posting, please email me at <a href="mailto:ThePodCast@Delphi.org">ThePodCast@Delphi.org</a> and hopefully the spam filter on my email doesn't filter you too.
