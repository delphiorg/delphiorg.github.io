I consider this pretty exciting news.  As of today <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> has awarded it's first <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges/65/delphi">Delphi badge</a> for users who earn 400 upvotes on questions tagged <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/delphi">Delphi</a>.

I was actually quite surprised to be the first to receive it.  Ever since Stack Overflow started I really wanted to see Delphi listed as one of the top category tags and badges.   As of today it is one of twenty specialist badges and the 46th <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags">most common tag</a> (not including the 13 variations like VCL, Delphi2009, Delphi-Prism, etc.) with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/delphi">1,104 questions</a>.

I am very pleased with the wonderful Delphi community that makes it so fun to be a part of the site. I am frequently surprised with how fast someone answers a Delphi question before I get a chance too.  I am sure others feel the same way.  I look forward to seeing a lot of other community memebers earning their Delphi badge.  It is by far my favorite badge.  Who could ask for something better to be associated with!

I've considered adding a Stack Overflow category to my blog.

<strong>BTW</strong>, for anyone wondering where this week's podcast with <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/">Nick Hodges</a> is, we were planning to record it on Thursday which happens to be the day the vandals <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/topstories/ci_12111011">cut the fiber</a> leading to silicon valley.  Now <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/2009/04/14/39230">Nick is moving</a> from Delphi Product Manager to Delphi R&amp;D Manager.  I am still trying to get him on again for a podcast, I am just not sure when or what that will look like yet.
